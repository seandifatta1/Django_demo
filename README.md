# NFL Django Demo App

## Overview

The NFL Django Demo App is a web application built using Django, a high-level Python web framework. This application allows users to register, log in, and view NFL teams. It features user authentication and various other functionalities typical of a Django project.

## Installation

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nfl-django-demo-app.git
cd nfl-django-demo-app
Step 2: Set Up a Virtual Environment
It is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies. Here’s how you can set it up:

For macOS and Linux:

bash
Copy code
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
For Windows:

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
Step 3: Install Dependencies
With the virtual environment activated, install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Step 4: Run Migrations
Apply the migrations to set up the database:

bash
Copy code
python manage.py migrate
Step 5: Create a Superuser
Create a superuser to access the Django admin interface:

bash
Copy code
python manage.py createsuperuser
Step 6: Run the Development Server
Start the development server to run the application:

bash
Copy code
python manage.py runserver
You can now access the application at http://127.0.0.1:8000.

## What the App Does

- **User Authentication**: Users can register, log in, and log out.
- **Team Display**: Displays NFL teams grouped by their respective conferences and divisions.
- **User Management**: Admins can manage users via the Django admin interface.

## Technical Explanation

### Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

- **core**: Contains settings and configuration for the Django project.
- **custom_auth**: Custom authentication logic and forms.
- **my_team**: Application logic related to NFL teams.
- **results**: Handles the results and simulations of matches.
- **static**: Static files (CSS, JS, images).
- **templates**: HTML templates for rendering views.
- **manage.py**: Django's command-line utility for administrative tasks.

### Key Components

#### 1. User Authentication

User authentication is managed using Django’s built-in `auth` app. Custom user models and forms are implemented to extend the default functionality.

- **Forms**: Located in `custom_auth/forms.py`, custom forms handle user registration and authentication.
- **Views**: Located in `custom_auth/views.py`, views handle user registration, login, and logout.
- **URLs**: Routes are defined in `custom_auth/urls.py`.

#### 2. Team Display

The `my_team` app manages the display of NFL teams.

- **Models**: Located in `my_team/models.py`, models define the structure of the team data.
- **Views**: Located in `my_team/views.py`, views handle the logic for displaying teams.
- **Templates**: HTML templates for team display are located in `templates/team/`.

#### 3. Results and Simulations

The `results` app manages the simulation of matches and displays the results.

- **Views**: Located in `results/views.py`, views handle match simulations and result displays.
- **Templates**: HTML templates for results are located in `templates/results/`.

### Settings and Configuration

- **Settings**: The project settings are configured in `core/settings.py`.
- **URLs**: The main URL configuration is in `core/urls.py`.

### How to Extend the App

- **Adding New Features**: Create a new app using `python manage.py startapp new_app`. Add your models, views, and templates in the new app.
- **Modifying Existing Features**: Update the relevant files in the respective app directories (e.g., `my_team/views.py`, `custom_auth/forms.py`).
